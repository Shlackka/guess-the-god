    and offered a choice to play again or to end the game and be returned to the main menu/closed door depending on platform.

## Design

  - ### Colour Scheme
    - I chose these colours to create a visually striking and immersive experience that reflects the grandeur and mystique of mythology, with the dark red conveying a sense of ancient power, while the black and white provide clear, readable text and elements that stand out against the light, neutral background.

    - The colour palette below was created using **[Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com)**

      ![Colour Palette](assets/images/readme/colour-palette.png)

  - ### Typography
    - The primary font is 'Lato', sans-serif for general text, providing a clean and modern look. 
    
    - 'Vollkorn', serif is used for headings to add a touch of elegance and distinction.
    
    - All fonts were acquired through **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**.

  - ### Imagery
    - High-quality images of gods from different mythologies are used to create a visually engaging and educational experience.  
    The images are central to the quiz, helping users associate visual characteristics with each god.
    
    - All god images were created with the help of **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?oai-dm=1)**.

  - ### Languages Used
    - **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content of the web pages. HTML5 provides the semantic elements and structure necessary for a well-organized and accessible web application.
    
    - **CSS3**: Used for styling the web pages. CSS3 ensures that the application has a visually appealing and consistent design. It includes the use of Flexbox and Grid for layout, and media queries for responsiveness.
    
    - **JavaScript**: Used for adding interactivity to the web application. JavaScript powers the game's logic, user interactions, dynamic content updates, and animations.  
    Aswell as the use of modules to improve readability and scalability in the future.
    
    - **Markdown**: Used to write the README.

- __Landing Page/Title Page (Mobile)__

    - The mobile landing page, although missing the sliding feature image of the desktop version still offers the same asthetic with a identical title page.
    - A simple to use title page main menu offering the options of "Start Game" and "How to Play" with an attractive hero image to give a distinct feel to the game.

![Landing Page/Title Page Mobile](assets/images/readme/landing-page-mobile.png)

- __Instructions__

    - When the "How to Play" button is clicked a message window will open to give all the relevant instrutions the player will need.
    - The instructions window includes it's own "Start Game" button to avoid needing to return to the main menu.

![Instructions](assets/images/readme/instructions.png)

- __Game Zone__

    - A stylised image of a god will appear central to the player.
    - A question will display below the god image "To which mythology does this god/goddess belong?".
    - The answer buttons are displayed clearly below the question each in the same style as the main site.
    - A hint button is displayed below the answer buttons clearly stating the repercussion for using a hint.

![Game Zone](assets/images/readme/game-zone.png)

- __Score__

![Score](assets/images/readme/score.png)

- __Alert Box (Answer)__

    - For each action the player performs a message box will appear central to the screen.
    - Uses an "x" in the top right corner as a close button.
    - Will give the player feedback on their chosen answer whether it was right or wrong.

![Alert Box Answer](assets/images/readme/alert-box-answer.png)

- __Alert Box (Hint)__

    - Will give the player a hint dependant on the current god/goddess displayed.
    - The hint can be displayed as many times as the player would like for each god/goddess.

![Alert Box Hint](assets/images/readme/alert-box-hint.png)

- __Alert Box (End Game)__

    - The message box will contain 2 buttons upon reaching an end game state "End Game" and "Play Again".
    - The "x" in the top right will not appear for this message so as not to present an unwanted loop in game.

![Alert Box End Game](assets/images/readme/alert-box-end-game.png)

### Features Not Yet Implemented

- __Gladiator Dropdown__

    - I had planned to implement a dropdown on the gladiators information page to work on smaller screens much like the nav menu.
    - This would have only shown the relevant information for the chosen gladiator rather than having the whole page as a long scrollable page.

## Testing

Each feature of the game has been tested upon integration and also tested again upon completion of development, these tests will be outlined below.

- **Sliding Images**: The sliding images on the landing page were tested to ensure they animate correctly  
and reveal the main menu upon clicking the "Enter The Pantheon" button. The transition and timing were checked for smoothness and alignment.

- **Navigation Buttons**: All buttons present within the site have been tested to confirm they perform the correct actions:
    - The "Start Game" button begins the game.

    - The "How to Play" button displays the instructions.

    - The "Play Again" and "End Game" buttons appear at the end of the game, and they respectively restart the game or return the user to the main menu.

- **Answer Buttons**:  Each answer button was tested to ensure it registers the correct mythology when clicked. The correct feedback message is displayed based on the user's choice.
 
- **Hint Button**:  The hint button was tested to ensure it displays the correct hint and deducts points only the first time it is used for each god.  
The score is adjusted accordingly, and hintsUsed array functions properly to prevent repeated point deduction for the same hint.

- **Score Calculation**:  The scoring system was tested to ensure points are correctly awarded for correct answers and deducted for hints.  
The score resets properly when the game is restarted.

- **Alert Box**:  The custom alert box was tested to ensure it displays the correct messages for user feedback, and the close button functions as expected.  
Additionally, the answer buttons are temporarily disabled when the alert box is shown and re-enabled upon closing.

- **Responsive Design**: The layout and functionality were tested across different screen sizes and devices to ensure the game maintains its structural integrity and usability.

- **Accessibility**: All images were tested for appropriate alt text to ensure accessibility. Color contrast was checked to meet accessibility guidelines.

### Lighthouse Testing

Along with feature testing I have also run lighthouse tests, these have come back very positive as seen below with the screen captures.

### Unfixed Bugs

To the best of my knowledge after testing all aspects of the site I have been unable to find any unfixed bugs.

## Deployment

The site has been deployed to GitHub pages, in order to do this the following steps were completed.

- From within the Gladiatour repo I navigated to the settings tab

- In settings navigate to the Pages section under "Code and automation"

- Once in Pages, I chose to deploy from a branch as my source and then chose the Main branch before clicking save

- The deployed site can be found at **https://shlackka.github.io/Gladiatour/index.html**

If you wish to fork the repo this can be achieved by using the "Fork" button at the top of the repo.

If you wish to clone the repo this can be achieved by using the drop down on the green "code" button and copying the URL into a workspace of your choosing such as **[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)** or **[CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/)**.

## Credits 

In the below section I will go over all of the external sources where I either drew inspiration or used their tools to assist in the development of Gladiatour.
